*TASK DESCRIPTION*:

The "Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics" project was developed to help users monitor and analyze the time they spend across different websites, categorizing them into productive (like coding platforms) and unproductive (like social media). The extension runs in the background, recording the duration of visits to various sites, and stores this data in a backend database. The frontend dashboard—built using React.js—displays analytics such as total time spent, breakdown by site category, and even weekly productivity reports using graphical summaries. The backend was created with Node.js and Express.js, while MongoDB was used for persistent storage of user activity logs.

The development was carried out in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), with the Chrome extension comprising files like manifest.json, background.js, and content scripts. The dashboard component, created inside a React project, communicates with the backend API endpoints (/api/log, /api/summary) to display real-time and historical usage data. These endpoints record time entries and generate summary reports using aggregation logic, and the server runs locally on http://localhost:5000. By classifying websites into categories, the tool helps users become more aware of how they utilize their screen time and adjust their habits accordingly.

In real life, this kind of extension is extremely beneficial for students, developers, freelancers, or remote employees who want to stay focused and manage their digital routines. It acts as a self-monitoring tool, providing insights that can lead to better time management and reduced distractions. Such extensions form the foundation of productivity platforms and digital well-being tools like RescueTime and Clockify. Through this project, key concepts in Chrome extension development, REST API integration, and full-stack development were explored and implemented effectively.
